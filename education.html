    <h3>Education</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>University of Warsaw, Master's of Neurocognitive Science, <em>2019-2021</em></li><br>
      <ul>My master's thesis subject was titled "Heart Rate Variability and Pupil Diameter at Rest".
        During the course of my studies I was trained to become a multidisciplinary scientist. The studies
        were conducted in English. During the time of the studies I learned programming in python and
        R, doing statistics for scientific research, how the whole process of academic and commercial
        research is done. Frequently I was presenting different materials. One of the crucial abilities
        that I gained during the studies is ability to learn quickly, because multidisciplinary field simply
        requires this.</ul><br>
      <li>University of Warsaw, Bachelor's of Philosophy, <em>2016-2019</em></li><br>
      <ul>My main field of study during the studies was philosophy of mind. I learned a great deal of
        logic, critical thinking, critical analysis, philosophy of science, history of philosophy, philosophy of
        action and philosophy of mind. Philosophy showed my how to take perspective and how to deal
        with and find problems that have not been yet defined but solutions to them can be illuminating.
        Philosophy is also a pragmatic discipline that allows for finding flaws in one's understanding or
        reasoning and defining solutions.</ul><br>
